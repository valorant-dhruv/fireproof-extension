# fireproof-extension v1
This repository contains the code for a sample fireproof todo list application wherein users can create multiple databases and save documents within each of the database.

Now using this demo application and the code for the extension, we are able to create a chrome extension as well create a panel within chrome devtools which displays a list of all the database names that are provisioned
using fireproof inside the application
